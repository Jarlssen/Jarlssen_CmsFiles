Jarlssen_CmsFiles
=================

This module aids front-end developers in development of CMS content. On a live project, the CMS content must be part of the database to allow the shop owner to edit it, but during development this requirement is an impediment to collaboration.

Jarlssen_CmsFiles will allow you to create files (versioned with your favourite SCM tool) in a path of your choice that will (optionally, during development) override the content of those in the database. It also provides an adminhtml interface and a script for easy merging between database and file entries
